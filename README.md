An Aperture shader pack implementing [Enhanced Subpixel Morphological Antialiasing 1x](https://github.com/iryoku/smaa) with improved edge detection using [redmean color difference](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/Color_difference#sRGB).

It intelligently smoothes diagonal edges to reduce staircase-like artifacts with minimal performance impact, while leaving color, lighting and large-scale geometry as identical as possible to vanilla Minecraft.
